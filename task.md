# Campus Life & Dashboard Enhancements — Task Tracker

## Phase 1: Backend Setup & API Routes (`server/server.js`)
- [x] Implement `updateEvent` helper in `server/server.js`
- [x] Add `GET /api/clubs/:id/managers` route to fetch club leaders and designations
- [x] Add `PUT /api/events/:id/pin` route for administrators to pin/unpin events

## Phase 2: Frontend Shared State (`src/App.jsx`)
- [x] Declare `clubs` and `events` states in `App.jsx`
- [x] Implement `fetchClubs` and `fetchEvents` callbacks in `App.jsx`

## Phase 3: Dashboard Recommendations (`src/components/Dashboard.jsx`)
- [x] Add "Upcoming Events" UI section to `Dashboard.jsx`
- [x] Implement interest-based scoring algorithm (CSE/AI/Data Science programs & courses)
- [x] Sort recommendations: pinned/sponsored first, interest matches second, then date
- [x] Add admin `📌 Pin` / `📍 Unpin` button toggles on the dashboard cards

## Phase 4: Simplified Cards & Detail Modals (`src/components/CampusLife.jsx`)

- [x] Add admin `📌 Pin` / `📍 Unpin` button toggles on the cards

## Phase 5: Verification & Verification Checks
- [x] Run `npm run lint` to verify clean frontend linter status

## Phase 6: Privacy Policy and Terms & Conditions Redirection
- [x] Update frontend hyperlinks in Auth.jsx to point back to /terms and /privacy
- [x] Create TermsAndConditions.jsx with IT Act / DPDP Act / GDPR compliance details

- [x] Add client-side pathname checks in App.jsx to render the documents on /terms and /privacy routes
- [x] Remove Express backend 302 redirects in server.js to allow page loading
- [x] Verify clean eslint validation and production build compilation

## Phase 7: Zero-Delay Deployment & SMTP Resiliency
- [x] Implement database-backed persistent JWT_SECRET lookup for serverless environments
- [x] Make SMTP verification warning-only on boot to avoid pre-emptive registration lockouts
- [x] Add dynamic transporter re-verification on the health check endpoint
